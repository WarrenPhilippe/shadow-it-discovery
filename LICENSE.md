Listen up, kid. You just found some code that pokes at the shadows of the internet. This is **passive reconnaissance**, nothing more — we don’t do scanning, exploiting, or breaking stuff.  

You’re free to:

- Use it.  
- Copy it.  
- Modify it.  
- Merge it.  
- Publish it.  
- Distribute it.  
- Sell it (if you’re feeling entrepreneurial).  
- Brag about it at the next security meetup.  

Just don’t be dumb:

- Keep my copyright notice intact.  
- Keep this warning intact.

### ⚠️ Reality Check

This software comes **as is**, no warranties. Nada. Zip. Zero.  

- If your dog eats your laptop, not my problem.  
- If your organization blows up because you ran this on a network without permission, not my problem.  
- If some script kiddie sues you for accidentally seeing something on Google… still not my problem.  

You get it? Good.

### 👀 Bottom Line

This tool is **for legit, authorized reconnaissance and research only**.  

- No breaking and entering.  
- No stealing secrets.  
- No pretending you’re James Bond at your client’s expense.  

If you use it responsibly: welcome to the shadows.  
If you don’t: well… enjoy your court date.

# TL;DR
Use smart. Stay legal. Have fun.
