# ⚖️ Why This Is Legal (And Won’t Get You Arrested)

Shadow IT Discovery is **100% passive**.

We only:

* Query Google
* Read certificate transparency logs
* Use passive DNS data
* Organise public information

We never:

* Scan ports
* Attempt logins
* Exploit vulnerabilities
* Send payloads
* Touch target systems

> Publicly indexed data is not private data.

If it appears in Google search results, it is already exposed.

### Still, Don’t Be Stupid

* Only assess domains you own **or**
* Have explicit permission to assess

This tool highlights exposure — it doesn’t break anything.
