# 🧠 Project Philosophy

Security teams love believing they know everything:

* Asset inventory? ✅
* DNS records? ✅
* Cloud dashboards? ✅
* Certificates? ✅

Meanwhile, attackers are busy finding:

* Forgotten portals
* Legacy apps
* Test systems “temporarily” exposed in 2019
* Vendor platforms nobody owns anymore

Shadow IT Discovery flips the question:

> What does the **internet** think you own?

No credentials.
No scans.
No touching systems.

Just exposure.
