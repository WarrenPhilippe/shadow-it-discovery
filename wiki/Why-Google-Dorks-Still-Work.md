# 🔍 Why Google Dorks Still Work

Every year someone declares:

> “Google dorks are dead.”

They are wrong.

### The Reality

* Google still indexes URLs
* Google still indexes subdomains
* Google still indexes legacy applications
* Google still indexes HTTP-only systems

What changed?

* Rate limits.
* Not capability.

Attackers still use Google dorks because **they work**.

> If Google can find it, so can anyone else — quietly.
